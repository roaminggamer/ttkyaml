ttkyaml
=======

TtkYaml is a Python module for constructing ttk (Tkinter) user interfaces 
dynamically from a GUI dictionary or a yaml file. Using TtkYaml help to build
ttk user interfaces using a programming language independent description file or a GUI 
description dictionary. In some cases using a none programing langage GUI description 
is easier to work with then programing the GUI using a programing language. 

The none programing langage GUI description can be a python dict object, or a file that
can be read and parsed as a dictionary. If pyYAML is installed, the module can use this
module to read and parse the file as a GUI description dict. if the pyYAML module is missing,
users can build a GUI description dict using other methods.

Tkinter is Python's de-facto standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) package.
